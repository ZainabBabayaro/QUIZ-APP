Quiz App Logic:
1) From the default question, set SUBMIT to perform two functions:
-Decide whether answer is count right or wrong, then add it to counter
-Act as a slide right arrow and brings in the next question.
NB- Count of the new questions should be added to the old count.

2) After the last question, a summary slide comes in.
-It shows % of the correct count against the total question. correctCount/totalCount*100
It'll print as ''%
